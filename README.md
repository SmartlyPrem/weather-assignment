To use this project in your system, first install React in your system. After this download all the above codes. I have not uploaded the Node_modules file here, so you will have to run the command "npm install" in your terminal.
In this way you can install the node_modules file. After this you need to install some required packages, such as "React router dom", "Axios", "react icons", "tailwind css".
Finally you can start the project by typing "npm start" in Terminal.
